## Upgrade your technical skills with deliberate practice

### If you build software you program every day. That doesn't mean you get better at programming every day.
Improving your hard technical skills makes all the software you build better. It exposes you to new opportunities, expands your knowledge into multiple fields and ultimately allows you to do more things with computers.

It doesn't happen by accident. In this market, you will be rewarded handsomely for building one boring CRUD application after another. To upgrade your hard technical skills however, you'll need to apply deliberate practice.

The key ideas behind deliberate practice is that it:

Pushes you just outside your comfort zone
Repeated often
Feedback on results in continuously available
It's highly demanding mentally
It's difficult
It requires good goals

The Matasano Crypto Challenges are a great example of a set of exercises that meet these criteria for the majority of intermediate to senior level developers.
