## The OSI model is
a conceptual framework that is used to describe how a network functions.
In plain English, the OSI model helped standardize the way computer systems send information to each other.

OSI model is not a set of rules. It is a tool for understanding how networks function.

## The OSI model consists of 7 layers of networking.
### Physical Layer :
everything from physical network devices, cabling, to how the cables hook up to the devices
 ### Data Link:
 Layerdefines how data is formatted for transmission, how much data can flow between nodes, for how long, and what to do when errors are detected in this flow.
### Network Layer:
send information between and across networks through the use of routers
### Transport Layer :
This where we dive into the nitty gritty specifics of the connection between two nodes and how information is transmitted between them
### Session Layer:
This layer establishes, maintains, and terminates sessions.
### Presentation Layer :
This layer is responsible for data formatting, such as character encoding and conversions, and data encryption.
### Application Layer :
this is the layer that is ultimately responsible for supporting services used by end-user applications.

## What Socket.IO is ?

is a library that enables low-latency, bidirectional and event-based communication between a client and a server.
