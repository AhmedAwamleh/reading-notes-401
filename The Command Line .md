A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.

. Line 1 presents us with a prompt ( user@bash ).
. Lines 2 - 5 are output from running the command.
. Line 6 presents us with a prompt again. After the command has run and the terminal is ready for you to enter another command

This is a part of the operating system that defines how the terminal will behave and looks after running (or executing) commands for you. There are various shells available but the most common one is called bash which stands for Bourne again shell. This tutorial will assume you are using bash as your shell.
