## A Graph is 
a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. 
The nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph.
More formally a Graph can be defined as, A Graph consisting of a finite set of vertices(or nodes) and a set of edges that connect a pair of nodes.

## Basic Properties of a Graph

A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges.
The nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph.
Properties of Graphs are basically used for the characterization of graphs depending on their structures.
We defined these properties in specific terms that pertain to the domain of graph theory.
In this article, we are going to discuss some properties of Graphs these are as follows:

### Distance between two Vertices:
### Radius of a Connected Graph
### Diameter of A Connected Graph
### Central Point and Centre

## Difference between graph and tree

### Graph :

A graph is a collection of two sets V and E where V is a finite non-empty set of vertices and E is a finite non-empty set of edges.

Vertices are nothing but the nodes in the graph.
Two adjacent vertices are joined by edges.
Any graph is denoted as G = {V, E}.

-	Graph is a non-linear data structure. 
-	It is a collection of vertices/nodes and edges.
-	Each node can have any number of edges.
-	There is no unique node called root in graph.
-	A cycle can be formed.
-	For graph traversal, we use Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Depth-First Search (DFS).
-	For finding shortest path in networking graph is used.
### Tree :

A tree is a finite set of one or more nodes such that –

There is a specially designated node called root.
The remaining nodes are partitioned into n>=0 disjoint sets T1, T2, T3, …, Tn 
where T1, T2, T3, …, Tn are called the subtrees of the root.

-	Tree It is a collection of vertices/nodes and edges.
-	It is a collection of nodes and edges.
-	There is a unique node called root(parent) node in trees.
-	There will not be any cycle.
-	We traverse a tree using in-order, pre-order, or post-order traversal methods.
-	For game trees, decision trees, the tree is used.
