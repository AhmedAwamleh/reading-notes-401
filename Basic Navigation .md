# Basic Navigation 

## In this section, we'll learn the basics of moving around the system. Many tasks rely on being able to get to, or reference the correct location in the system. As such, this stuff really forms the foundation of being able to work effectively in Linux. Make sure you understand it well.

### pwd :
The command does just that. It tells you what your current or present working directory
### ls
 ls. It's short for list
### path
  A path is a means to get to a particular file or directory on the system
### cd
