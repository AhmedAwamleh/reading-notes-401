# Stack and Queues

## What's the difference between Stack and Queue?
### Stack:
1-Stack is used for expression evaluation 
2-Stack is used for parenthesis matching while working with expressions.
3-Stack is used in expression conversion. For example, infix to postfix or prefix to postfix
4-Stack is used in memory management
5-It is used in java virtual machine
6-It is used for the Backtracking problem-solving method
7-It is used in string parsing or string reversal. 
8-Stack is used to matching the HTML tags in web development
9-Stack is also used in function call for recursive functions. 
### Queue
1-The queue is used as a waiting list when the resource is to be shared with multiple systems. For example, CPU scheduling or disk scheduling 
2-It is used in the operating system for FCFS scheduling, semaphores, buffer for devices and spooling the printers
3-Queues are used in routers and switches 
4-In networking, the queue is used when data is transferred asynchronously 
5-Used in maintaining the playlist in media players
6-Used to handle interrupts in the operating system
7-The queue is used in the round-robin scheduling algorithm
## What is Stacks and how to use it?
Stack is a data structure in which the element added last is removed first. It follows Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.
For implementing Stack in constant time, we can use Arrayâ€™s push(value) /pop() method for insertion/deletion or we can use Linked List to insert and remove at the beginning.

## What is Queue?
Queue is a data structure in which the element which is added first is removed first. It follows First In First Out (FIFO) principle.
